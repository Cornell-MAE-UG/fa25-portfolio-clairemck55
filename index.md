## About Me
I’m a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with hands-on experience in mechanical design, testing, and analysis. I’ve worked on thermal, vibration, and system-level design problems through internships at Rivian and SLAC Accelerator Laboratory, and I currently lead the ergonomics subteam for Cornell Racing’s Formula SAE electric vehicle.
