Project overview
Our project focuses on designing a three blade wind turbine for the MAE 4272 Big Blue wind tunnel that maximizes power output while remaining structurally safe and compatible with the experimental and physical constraints. Since the turbine is meant to function in our lab wind tunnel, it has to follow specific constraints. Each blade must remain under the 6 inch span limit. The blade root must be compatible with the 1-inch hub. To ensure safe operation the turbine cannot exceed 3000 RPM. All blades were grey resin 3D prints with a flexural strength of 44 MPa. Our required FOS was 1.5 to ensure there are no failures.

Design process:  
We combined theoretical principles such as the Weibull distribution for wind characterization, 1-D Momentum theory, and Blade Element-Momentum theory to design an efficient blade targeting a specific tip speed ratio. Using a MATLAB script, we generated and evaluated ideal chord and pitch distributions across a range of angular velocities and wind speeds. The script incorporated low-Reynolds NACA 66(1)-212 polar data, accounted for axial wind velocity reduction induced by the foils, matched the local tip-speed-ratio distribution along the span, and swept angles of attack within the pre-stall range. The result was a high-resolution 3D blade geometry generated by repeatedly computing the spanwise lift and drag tangential forces and iterating until converging on the maximum torque. For our geometry, we also evaluated the bending stress distribution along the blade to ensure the design remained structurally safe under the expected operating conditions.

Testing summary: 
Although our turbine is designed to be optimal at a specific wind speed we decided to test the turbine at different wind speeds to get a full picture because we were not sure if our design would operate as we planned. At each fan speed we incremented the torque brake voltage by .4V then waited until RPM was stable meaning the turbine was in equilibrium. Then we pulled data and kept increasing the torque brake until the turbine either stalled (indicating that maximum power was reached) or we reached the torque brake voltage limit. We repeated this process for all fan speeds. With the data we collected we are able to analyze our blade at different operating conditions and draw conclusions about our blade performance using power curves and efficiency calculations.

My contribution: 
I mostly worked on identifying which theoretical principles of windpower to condsider when designing this turbine. I did research on wind power principles such as BEM theory, Betz limit derivation, tip speed ratio, and figured out how to relate the constraints of the design to optimal blade design theory. I helped with developing the CAD. Lastly I put together all the power curves and helped analyze the data.
